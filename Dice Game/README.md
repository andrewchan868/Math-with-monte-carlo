# Expected Payoff from a Dice Game

## Problem Statement
Suppose you roll a dice. For each roll, you are paid the face value of the dice. If a roll results in a 4, 5, or 6, you can roll the dice again. However, once you get a 1, 2, or 3, the game stops. The objective is to determine the expected payoff of this game.

## Mathematical Approach

Thus, the expected payoff from this game is $7.

## Monte Carlo Approach
After running Monte Carlo, it is 6.98
